# Personal Projects List

## Keeping up with the Kop

General Idea:

- Liverpool fc fan site
- uses https://www.football-data.org/index for club information such as fixtures, results, players etc
- use https://newsapi.org for latest news
- maybe use links to wikipedia for users to find out more information about key words such as specific players or competitions

## nELP

General idea:

- To get a better understanding of grapgQL, I'm aiming to build a website that uses https://www.yelp.com/developers/graphql/guides/intro
- Site that displays the top 10 restaurants in specific locations that the user searches for
- Cards will display a variety of information such as reviews, prices etc

## F1 weekly

General idea:

- I don't have time to keep up with Formula 1 any more so I want to build a website that provides me with the latest information on the weekend's racing
- Uses the http://ergast.com/mrd/ API
- After a brief read, data may be returned in XML
- Future implementation could be to provide users with data prior to this season

## What's in Nero's Pocket?

General idea:

- I use the Pocket app daily to save articles I find interesting and would like to read on the way home. My firends always ask me to send links of articles I find interesting but it would be easier to have a site that automatically hosts articles I'm currntly reading or have read in the past
- API key generated from my Pocket account
- Basic cards with urls, images, titles etc
- API docs: https://getpocket.com/developer/
- NOTE: to better understand how browsers, frameworks, infrastructure works the idea is to build the app with React first then go back and build it as a static html page with logic extracted out into lambdas, look into caching and ways to make the application more efficient.

## What the FX?!

General idea:

- I regularly check specific currency pairs, precious metal prices and cryptocurrency prices
- Consolidating the values I check using various websites in one place would make my daily price checks far more efficient
- Future implementation could involve graphs of historical prices, trends etc
- APIs to use: https://fixer.io, https://ratesapi.io, https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/, https://silvergoldbull.co.uk/api/
